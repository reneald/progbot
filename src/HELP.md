__**Progbot help**__

__**Commands**__
* `!help` - this page
* `!addband Tool` - adds Tool to the list of band names. Note: this doesn't (yet) check wether the given band name is already in the list. Exploit this: keep adding the same band name to raise the chance of it being selected!
* `!band` - answers with a random bandname from the list
* `!search Tool` - does a Spotify search for Tool. This searches artists for now, and simply returns a link to the first result.
